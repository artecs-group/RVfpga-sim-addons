# RVfpga: Recent Additions and Updates

## Teaching experiences in year 2024-25
This repository provides materials from a range of RVfpga-based teaching experiences, primarily conducted during the 2024-25 academic year.

We first show how we adapted and used the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) and the [RVfpga-SoC](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/) packages provided by Imagination Technologies, as well as the [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator, in the labs of three courses instructed at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM).

+ **Computer Fundamentals**: This is a first-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder **[Computer_Fundamentals](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Fundamentals)** of this repository you can find all the materials used in the course. Since this is an introductory course, we only use Ripes in the labs.

+ **Computer Organization**: This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder **[Computer_Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization)** of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. For the labs, we use a combination of Ripes and RVfpga-based exercises.

+ **Integrated Systems Architecture**: This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree program at UCM. In folder **[Integrated_Systems_Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture)** of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. Since this is an advanced course, we mainly use RVfpga-based labs.

We also participated in the [Master de Formaci칩n Permanente en Sistemas Microelectr칩nicos Basados en Arquitecturas Abiertas](https://www.uclm.es/estudios/propios/master-formacion-permanente-sistemas-microelectricos-basados-arquitecturas-abiertas) at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM). Specifically, within the course Dise침o de Microcontroladores en Hardware Abierto, we taught an entire two-week-long module based on RVfpga. You can find the details in the following folder: **[Design_Microcontrollers_Open_Hardware](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Design_Microcontrollers_Open_Hardware)**.

We developed an **[RVfpga-based MOOC](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/the-linux-foundation-computer-architecture-with-an-industrial-risc-v-core)** in edX. This MOOC course includes 10 chapters that cover labs 1-4, 6-9, and 11 of the RVfpga course. The chapters provide instructions, hands-on tutorials, videos with demonstrations, exercises, and multiple-choice questions.

In recent years, we have also supervised several Bachelor's and Master's theses based on RVfpga. The following are among the most significant:
    - Bachelor Thesis **[Floating-point extensions for the SweRV EH1 core](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/274f1b3a-c564-464d-8066-ef9aa4ae3c10)**
    - Master thesis **[FPGA implementation of an AD-HOC RISC-V system-on-chip for industrial IoT](https://docta.ucm.es/entities/publication/9298fbe5-cabd-40a0-bec5-0501290c30d1)**

Finally, in the second semester of year 2024-25, we will deliver a microcredential as part of a joint effort between UCM and [OpenChip](https://openchip.com/). You can find all the details here: **[RISC-V: Arquitectura y dise침o basado en cores comerciales VeeR sobre FPGA](https://riscv.fdi.ucm.es/)**.
