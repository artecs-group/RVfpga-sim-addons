# RVfpga

## Teaching experiences at UCM (Sept-2024)
In this repository, we show how we adapted and used the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) and the [RVfpga-SoC](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/) packages provided by Imagination Technologies, in the labs of two courses instructed at UCM.

+ Computer Organization: This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program offered at UCM. In folder [Computer_Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. 

+ Integrated Systems Architecture: This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree that we offer at UCM. In folder [Integrated Systems Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course.

*NOTE: In case you want to obtain more information about these courses (such as the slides, the exercises sheets, the solutions for the labs, etc.), you can contact ```dani02@ucm.es```*

## New simulation tools (Nov-2022)
In this repository, we also provide two [simulation tools](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/SimulationTools) that can be used in conjunction with RVfpga.

*NOTE: The courses mentioned above include modified versions of these simulation tools, which are included in the materials provided for the courses. Moreover, v3 of the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) materials also includes newer versions of these tools.*
