# RVfpga

## Teaching experiences at UCM (Sept-2024)
In this repository, we show how we adapted and used the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) and the [RVfpga-SoC](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/) packages provided by Imagination Technologies, as well as the [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator, in the labs of two courses instructed at UCM.

+ Computer Organization: This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder [Computer_Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. 

+ Integrated Systems Architecture: This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree program at UCM. In folder [Integrated_Systems_Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course.

If you're interested in learning more about the details of the RVfpga course, you can view a paper that we've recently released:

## New simulation tools (Outdated)
In this repository, we also provide two [Simulation Tools](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/SimulationTools) that can be used in conjunction with RVfpga.

*IMPORTANT NOTE: The courses mentioned above include newer versions of these simulation tools, which are included in the materials provided for the courses. Moreover, v3 of the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) materials and the [RVfpga edX](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-programming/the-linux-foundation-computer-architecture-with-an-industrial-risc-v-core) course also include newer versions of these tools.*
