# RVfpga: Recent Additions and Updates

## Teaching experiences -- Academic year 2024-25
In this repository, we provide materials from various RVfpga-based teaching experiences conducted during the 2024-25 academic year.

We first show how we adapted and used the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) and the [RVfpga-SoC](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/) packages provided by Imagination Technologies, as well as the [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator, in the labs of two courses instructed at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM).

+ Computer Organization: This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder [Computer_Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. 

+ Integrated Systems Architecture: This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree program at UCM. In folder [Integrated_Systems_Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course.

We also participated in the [Master de Formaci칩n Permanente en Sistemas Microelectr칩nicos Basados en Arquitecturas Abiertas](https://www.uclm.es/estudios/propios/master-formacion-permanente-sistemas-microelectricos-basados-arquitecturas-abiertas) at the University of Castilla-La Mancha (UCLM). Specifically, within the course Dise침o de Microcontroladores en Hardware Abierto, we taught an entire two-week-long module based on RVfpga. You can find the details in the following folder: [Design_Microcontrollers_Open_Hardware](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Design_Microcontrollers_Open_Hardware).

Finally, in the second semester, we will deliver a microcredential as part of a joint effort between UCM and [OpenChip](https://openchip.com/). You can find all the details here: [RISC-V: Arquitectura y dise침o basado en cores comerciales VeeR sobre FPGA](https://riscv.fdi.ucm.es/).

In addition to all these RVfpga-based materials, in this repository we also provide the materials (not RVfpga-based) used in another course instructed at the University Complutense of Madrid (UCM).

+ Computer Fundamentals: This is a first-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder [Computer_Fundamentals](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Fundamentals) of this repository you can find part most of the materials used in the course.
