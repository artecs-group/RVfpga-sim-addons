# RVfpga: Recent Additions and Updates

## Teaching experiences at UCM (academic year 2024-25)
In this repository, we show how we adapted and used the [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) and the [RVfpga-SoC](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/) packages provided by Imagination Technologies, as well as the [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes) simulator, in the labs of two courses instructed at UCM.

+ Computer Organization: This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program at UCM. In folder [Computer_Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course. 

+ Integrated Systems Architecture: This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree program at UCM. In folder [Integrated_Systems_Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture) of this repository you can find part of the materials (mainly the labs) used in the course.
