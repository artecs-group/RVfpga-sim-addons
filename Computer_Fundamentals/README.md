# Computer Fundamentals

This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program offered at UCM. You can see the contents of this course at [Computer Organization UCM](http://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2024/8704.pdf).

The theoretical part of the course provides an in-depth analysis of the RISC-V architecture and assembly programming, along with single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pipelined processors as described in the Harris&Harris book. Exercises and labs are included to reinforce and deepen understanding of these topics. All these materials are provided through an external webpage, both in Spanish [FC2](https://www.fdi.ucm.es/profesor/mendias/FC2/FC2.html) and in English [FC2](https://www.fdi.ucm.es/profesor/mendias/FC2/FC2-en.html).

In this course, some exercises and labs are not only solved on paper but are also analyzed through simulations using [Ripes](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes). Students will use their own laptops or request one from the school. They will install and run Ripes natively on their devices. The following are the steps students must follow to simulate the selected exercises:

### RISC-V Architecture and Assembly Language


### RISC-V Single/Multi-Cycle and Pipelined Processors


*NOTE: This course will be conducted during the second semester of the 2024-2025 academic year (February 2025 to May 2025). During this time, the course materials will continue to be refined and enhanced.*
