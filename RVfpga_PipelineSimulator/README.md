This folder includes everything related with the **RVfpga-PipelineSimulator**:

* We recommend you to first go into folder *examples* and perform the simulation of the example program provided there. In that folder, you will find detailed instructions on how to simulate the program in the **RVfpga-PipelineSimulator** using the simulator binaries provided as a release (*RVfpga_PipelineSimulator_Ubuntu* and *RVfpga_PipelineSimulator_Windows*). We also explain how to create and simulate other programs and how to integrate the simulator in VSCode/PlatformIO (the IDE used in RVfpga).

* In folder *verilatorSIM_RVfpga-PipelineSimulator* we provide the sources of the **RVfpga-PipelineSimulator**, as well as detailed instructions on how to compile them. This allows you to modify the simulator: you can add or remove signals, include more drawings or change the appereance, etc.

NOTE: Instruction dissasembly is carried out based on the [RISC-V Disassembler](https://github.com/michaeljclark/riscv-disassembler) developed by Michael Clark.
