* In folder *examples* we provide an example program, both with a source file and a .vh file, as well as detailed instructions on how to simulate it in the **RVfpga-PipelineSimulator** using the simulator binaries provided as a release (*RVfpga_PipelineSimulator_Ubuntu* and *RVfpga_PipelineSimulator_Windows*). We also explain how to create and simulate other programs.

* In folder *verilatorSIM_RVfpga-PipelineSimulator* we provide the sources of the **RVfpga-PipelineSimulator**, as well as detailed instructions on how to compile them. This allows you to modify the simulator: you can add or remove signals, include more drawings or change the appereance, etc.
