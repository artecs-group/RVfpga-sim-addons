* We recommend you to first go into folder *examples* and perform the simulation of the example program provided there. In that folder, you will find detailed instructions on how to simulate the program in the **RVfpga-ViDBo** simulator using the binaries that we provide as a release (*RVfpga_ViDBo_Ubuntu20* *RVfpga_ViDBo_Ubuntu22* and *RVfpga_ViDBo_Windows.exe*). In that folder we also explain how to create and simulate other programs and integrate the simulator in VSCode/PlatformIO (the IDE used in RVfpga).
