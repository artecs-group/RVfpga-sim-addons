# Lab 2 - The VeeR EH1 core
This practice aims to thoroughly understand the 5-stage pipelined processor in the Ripes simulator, which is almost identical to the H&H processor studied in theory, as well as the 2-way superscalar processor with 9 pipeline stages, the VeeR EH1.

We start by providing an introduction to the two simulators, which includes several examples that the students have to repeat on their own. The presentation can be obtained here: [Presentation-Lab2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LVfQ7ZxzACyaZoCJrFv6PCeGkGhF5cuW/view?usp=sharing).
