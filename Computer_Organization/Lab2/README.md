# Lab 2 - The VeeR EH1 core
This practice aims to thoroughly understand the 5-stage pipelined processor in the Ripes simulator, which is almost identical to the H&H processor studied in theory, as well as the VeeR EH1, a 2-way superscalar processor with 9 pipeline stages.

We start this module by providing a detailed introduction to the VeeR EH1 microarchitecture. The presentation can be obtained here: [VeeR-EH1_Microarchitecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rSlwCzcHD4F_S4YFLCFn3L0VNXH_sv7L/view?usp=drive_link). We then provide an introduction to the two simulators that we use, which includes several examples that the students have to repeat on their own. The presentation can be obtained here: [Presentation-Lab2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LVfQ7ZxzACyaZoCJrFv6PCeGkGhF5cuW/view?usp=sharing). 

Below, we briefly explain how to use the RVfpga-Pipeline and the Ripes simulator in the provided Virtual Machine. Then, you can find several exercises where we start analyzing simple processors (H&H and Ripes) and then we move to a more complex processor, VeeR EH1, which implements several advanced microarchitectural techniques.
