# Computer Organization at UCM
This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program offered at UCM. You can see the contents of this course at [Computer Organization UCM](http://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2024/8413.pdf).

As for the theoretical part, the course starts with a detailed revision of those concepts introduced in the Computer Fundamentals first-year course: RISC-V architecture and assembly programming, and the single/multi-cycle and pipelined processors from the Harris&Harris book. Then, the VeeR EH1 pipelined processor is used to introduce some advanced microarchitectural techniques, such as deep pipelining, superscalar execution and multi-cycle operations. Finally, a generic I/O system and memory system are analyzed in detail. 

The course includes five labs:

+ [Lab 0](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab0): Installation and Introduction.
+ [Lab 1](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab1): The RISC-V ISA.
+ [Lab 2](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab2): The VeeR EH1 core.
+ [Lab 3](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab3): The Memory Hierarchy.
+ [Lab 4](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab4): The RVfpga I/O System.

In this course, we do not have boards available for all students (ranging from 50 to 80 per year). Therefore, all exercises are conducted through simulations using tools such as Whisper, RVfpga-ViDBo, RVfpga-Pipeline, and Ripes, within a provided Virtual Machine. If you would like to use any of the boards supported by RVfpga (Nexys A7, Basys 3, and Boolean), you can find all the details at [RVfpga: Understanding Computer Architecture](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/). Additionally, this repository includes a more advanced course, [Integrated Systems Architecture](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture), where students work with a Nexys A7 board.
