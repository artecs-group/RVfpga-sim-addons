# Integrated Systems Architecture

This is a fourth-year course in the Electronics and Communication Engineering degree program offered at UCM. You can see the contents of this course at [Integrated Systems Architecture UCM](https://fisicas.ucm.es/data/cont/docs/18-2021-09-01-2021-22%20Gu%C3%ADa%20Docente%20GIEC%20v1.1-157-16091.pdf). 

The course starts with an introduction to the most recent trends in computer architecture, and then it explores exhaustively advanced processor design (deep pipelining, multi-cycle operations, speculative execution and branch prediction), the memory system (memory hierarchy, scratchpad memories), the I/O system, benchmarking and SoC design.

The course includes ten labs (some of them are identical to the labs used in the [Computer Organization](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization) course):

+ [Lab 0](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab0): Installation and Introduction.
+ [Lab 1](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab1): The RISC-V ISA.
+ [Lab 2](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab2): Introduction to the VeeR EH1 core.
+ Lab 3: Performance of the VeeR EH1 core. (*COMING SOON*)
+ Lab 4: Execution of basic instructions on the VeeR EH1 core. (*COMING SOON*)
+ [Lab 5](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab3): The Memory Hierarchy in Ripes.
+ Lab 6: The Memory Hierarchy in VeeR EH1. (*COMING SOON*)
+ [Lab 7](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab4): High-level Input/Output on the RVfpga SoC.
+ [Lab 8](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Integrated_Systems_Architecture/Lab8): Low-level Input/Output on the RVfpga SoC.
+ Lab 9: The [RVfpga-SoC package](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpgasoc-download-page-en/). (*COMING SOON*)

Students are provided with a Nexys A7 board per person that they can keep until the end of the semester. The VeeR EH1 core fits in this board and it is a more advanced processor than EL2 that allows us to explore concepts such as deep pipelining or multi-cycle operations, thus it is the core that we use in the course. In addition, students can use the different simulation tools available in RVfpga: Whisper, RVfpga-ViDBo, RVfpga-Pipeline and RVfpga-Trace.
