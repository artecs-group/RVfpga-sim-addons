# Lab 6 - The Memory Hierarchy in VeeR EH1
In this lab, we analyse the memory hierarchy of the RVfpga SoC, focusing in the scratchpad memories (ICCM and DCCM) available in the VeeR EH1 processor and we provide some benchmarking examples and exercises. Some of these tests and exercises can be done in simulation, but it's preferable to use an FPGA board. Remember that you can get all information concerning the creation of the bitstream in Vivado, the configuration and programming of the board, etc., in the complete [RVfpga](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) course. Moreover, you can visualize the following video from time 19:16 to time 21:55 to see an example of the Nexys A7 FPGA board running a program: [RVfpgaToolsVideo](https://youtu.be/Z8QcQRW7F4s?si=mP2EX5TRlPe8WD-O&t=1156) (the video is in Spanish, but you can watch an AI-translated-to-English version of the video here [RVfpgaToolsEnglishVideo](https://youtu.be/HuAF2XOMQmQ?si=whpN4rKCKX_Q08Z_&t=1156), you can watch an AI-translated-to-Chinese version of the video here [RVfpgaToolsChineseVideo](https://youtu.be/A_c8GACrW9w?si=2PF5bUfPfaN0RdjJ&t=1156), or you can enable the subtitles in the original video).
