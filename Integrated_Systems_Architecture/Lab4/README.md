# Lab 4 - Execution of basic instructions and adding new instructions on the VeeR EH1 core
In this lab we continue the analysis of the VeeR EH1 core, analyzing the execution of basic instructions and adding new instructions to the core. The exercises proposed can be performed both in simulation and on the FPGA board. In this repository, we explain how to use the simulators, and you can find all the instructions for running on the board in the complete [RVfpga](https://university.imgtec.com/rvfpga-el2-v3-0-english-downloads-page/) course.

Follow the next steps:

1. At time 11:12 of the following video, you can visualize an example of the RVfpga-Trace simulator running a program: [RVfpgaToolsVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8QcQRW7F4s) (the video is in Spanish, but you can watch an AI-translated-to-English version of the video here [RVfpgaToolsEnglishVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuAF2XOMQmQ), you can watch an AI-translated-to-Chinese version of the video here [RVfpgaToolsChineseVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_c8GACrW9w), or you can enable the subtitles in the original video).

2. View this video [PerformanceBenchmarkingVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqaDEW3W4X0) (the video is in Spanish, but you can watch an AI-translated-to-English version of the video here: [PerformanceBenchmarkingEnglishVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXB7jl1iGq8), or you can enable the subtitles in the video in Spanish). You can download the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/146nEyUkGkXn85cS15EiUM7R0Bv1nKyoT/view?usp=sharing). The video illustrates the following items:
    * How to extend the VeeR EH1 processor with new instructions and how we can improve its peformance using them (a description of how to add new instructions to VeeR EH1 is at time 6:29 and an example running on RVfpga-ViDBo is at time 14:49).

3. Perform the following exercises.
