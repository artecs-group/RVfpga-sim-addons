# Lab 3 - Performance of the VeeR EH1 core
In this lab we continue the analysis of the VeeR EH1 core.

You can follow the next steps:
1. View this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqaDEW3W4X0), which illustrates how we can measure performance in the RVfpga System, how we can extend the VeeR EH1 processor with new instructions and how we can improve its peformance using them, and finally how we can run the CoreMark benchmark in the RVfpga System. The video is in Spanish, but you can enable the subtitles and configure YouTube to automatically translate them into the language that you prefer.
2. Then, perform the tasks described in this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGfC3eKwRCBeBKfiidhMOVL4W1m-op-h/view?usp=sharing).
3. Finally, do the exercises described in this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T16218F899vQQYI3GKXBYW4VKzGgM_FX/view?usp=sharing).
