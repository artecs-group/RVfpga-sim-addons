# Lab 3 - Performance of the VeeR EH1 core
In this lab we continue the analysis of the VeeR EH1 core.

You can follow the next steps:
1. View this video [PerformanceBenchmarkingVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqaDEW3W4X0) (the video is in Spanish, but you can watch an AI-translated-to-English version of the video here: [PerformanceBenchmarkingEnglishVideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXB7jl1iGq8), or you can enable the subtitles in the video in Spanish). You can download the [slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/146nEyUkGkXn85cS15EiUM7R0Bv1nKyoT/view?usp=sharing). The video illustrates the following items:
    * How to measure performance in the RVfpga System (description of the VeeR EH1 Performance Counters is at time 0:10 and an example running on RVfpga-ViDBo is at time 2:14).
    * How to extend the VeeR EH1 processor with new instructions and how we can improve its peformance using them (a description of how to add new instructions to VeeR EH1 is at time 6:29 and an example running on RVfpga-ViDBo is at time 14:49).
    * How to run the CoreMark benchmark in the RVfpga System (at time 24:18).
3. Then, perform the tasks described in this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vGfC3eKwRCBeBKfiidhMOVL4W1m-op-h/view?usp=sharing).
4. Finally, do the exercises described in this [document](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1T16218F899vQQYI3GKXBYW4VKzGgM_FX/view?usp=sharing).
