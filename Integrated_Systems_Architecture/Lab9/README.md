# Running Zephyr on VeeRwolf
These resources provide detailed explanations on how to use Zephyr within the RVfpga/VeeRwolf environment, both in simulation and on the Nexys A7 board (highly recommended to fully leverage its capabilities). Additionally, you will find instructions for running a TensorFlow Lite model on Zephyr using the SoC we have studied in this module. Finally, we include some exercises, most of which can be performed in simulation and on the FPGA board.
