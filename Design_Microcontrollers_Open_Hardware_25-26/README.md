# Design of Microcontrollers in Open Hardware

In Weeks 5 and 6 of DISEÃ‘O DE MICROCONTROLADORES EN HARDWARE ABIERTO, students dive into the world of open hardware microcontrollers using the RVfpga platform. Through videos, guided exercises, and hands-on labs, they learn how to analyze the VeeR EH1/EL2 cores, explore input/output systems, evaluate processor performance, and use the Zephyr Operating System.
