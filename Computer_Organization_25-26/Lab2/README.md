# Lab 2 - The Ripes core and the VeeR EH1 core
This practice aims to help students gain a thorough understanding of the commercial VeeR EH1 core, an advanced 2-way superscalar processor with 9 pipeline stages. The processor is explained both theoretically, through a detailed presentation, and practically, using the RVfpga-Pipeline simulator. As a preparatory step, we first focus on the typical academic 5-stage pipelined processor, exploring it theoretically (using the pipelined processor from the Harris and Harris book, H&H) and practically (through the Ripes simulator). 

Follow the next steps:

1. **Ripes core:** You can start using Ripes to simulate and analyze a 5-stage processor that is almost identical to the one described in the H&H textbook.

    * Read again the instructions provided at [Ripes_Introduction](https://github.com/mortbopet/Ripes/blob/master/docs/introduction.md).
    * Replicate the instructions provided below in section *Basic use of the Pipelined processor*.
    * Then, complete exercises 1â€“6 provided below. The optional exercises are not mandatory, but they can help you improve your knowledge and your grade. Provide short and precise answers without getting lost in unnecessary details. The format is flexible: you may include code, explanations, simulator screenshots, videos, etc.

2. **VeeR EH1 core:** Once you have a clear understanding of the 5-stage processor used in the textbook and the one used in Ripes, you will start your analysis of a more complex processor, the VeeR EH1 core.

## Basic use of the *Pipelined processor*
The construction of the Pipelined processor is first explained theoretically using the slides provided above. During this explanation, students must perform the corresponding tests from the list below, executing the instructions and carefully analyzing the processor signals in detail.

1. Start the Ripes simulator.

2. Open the Processor tab and in the ```Select Processor``` icon, choose the processor with the following characteristics:
   - 5-stage processor.
   - RISC-V base instruction set plus M extension.
   - Extended layout.

4. Perform the example shown in the above slides ([BuildingRipesPipelined](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YEU6boOllnm3OXSRJV4YFuy86CcGv4En/view?usp=sharing)) for the ```sub``` instruction. Use the following code in Ripes:

```
li x2, 5
li x3, 3
nop
nop
nop
nop
sub x1, x2, x3
```
