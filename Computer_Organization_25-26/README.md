# Computer Organization 2025-26 at UCM
This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program offered at UCM. You can see the contents of this course at [Computer Organization UCM](https://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2025/8942.pdf).

As for the theoretical part, the course starts with a detailed revision of those concepts introduced in the Computer Fundamentals first-year course: RISC-V architecture and assembly programming, and the single/multi-cycle and pipelined processors from the Harris&Harris book. Then, the VeeR EH1 pipelined processor is used to introduce some advanced microarchitectural techniques, such as deep pipelining, superscalar execution and multi-cycle operations. Then, the memory system (cache hierarchy and virtual memory) is analyzed in detail. Finally, a generic I/O system is studied.

The course includes five labs:

+ [Lab 0](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab0): Introduction and Installation.
+ [Lab 1](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab1): The RISC-V ISA.
+ [Lab 2_25-26](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab2_25-26): The Ripes core and the VeeR EH1 core.

  *NOTE: If you are using the old RVfpga-Pipeline simulator, use this link instead: [Lab 2](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab2).*
+ [Lab 3](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab3): The Memory Hierarchy.
+ [Lab 4](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization/Lab4): The RVfpga I/O System.

In this course, we do not have boards available for all students (ranging from 50 to 80 per year). Therefore, all labs are conducted through simulations using tools such as RVfpga-ViDBo, RVfpga-Pipeline, and Ripes, within a provided Virtual Machine.
