# Computer Organization 2025-26 at UCM
This is a second-year course in the Computer Science degree program offered at UCM. You can see the contents of this course at [Computer Organization UCM](https://web.fdi.ucm.es/UCMFiles/pdf/FICHAS_DOCENTES/2025/8942.pdf).

As for the theoretical part, the course starts with a detailed revision of those concepts introduced in the Computer Fundamentals first-year course: RISC-V architecture and assembly programming, and the single/multi-cycle and pipelined processors from the Harris&Harris book. Then, the VeeR EH1 pipelined processor is used to introduce some advanced microarchitectural techniques, such as deep pipelining, superscalar execution and multi-cycle operations. Finally, a generic I/O system and memory system are analyzed in detail. 

The course includes five labs:

+ [Lab 0](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab0): Introduction and Installation.
+ [Lab 1](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab1): The RISC-V ISA.
+ [Lab 2](https://github.com/artecs-group/RVfpga-sim-addons/tree/main/Computer_Organization_25-26/Lab2): The Ripes core and the VeeR EH1 core.
+ Lab 3: The Memory Hierarchy.
+ Lab 4: The RVfpga I/O System.

In this course, we do not have boards available for all students (ranging from 50 to 80 per year). Therefore, all exercises are conducted through simulations using tools such as Whisper, RVfpga-ViDBo, RVfpga-Pipeline, and Ripes, within a provided Virtual Machine.
