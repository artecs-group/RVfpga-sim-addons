# Module 4 - SoC design based on the VeeR cores

The final module is the shortest and is simply intended as an introduction to SoC design. First, we will see how to create the RVfpga SoC from scratch by connecting various modules: the VeeR EH1 core, the interconnection network, and the peripherals. To do this, we will use the Vivado Block Design tool.

Once completed, we will run the SoC on the Nexys A7 board, compile, load, and execute the Zephyr RTOS on the SoC, and finally run a program based on TensorFlow Lite.
