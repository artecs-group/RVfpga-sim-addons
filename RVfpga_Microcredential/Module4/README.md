# Module 4 – Zephyr Project on VeeRwolf

## Overview

In this final module, you will learn how to compile and load applications based on the Zephyr Project RTOS onto the VeeRwolf SoC. Special attention will be given to understanding how support for this SoC has been integrated into Zephyr, with the goal of using it as a reference for future hardware platforms. Additionally, you will walk through an example of loading and running a TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers model on this RTOS.

## Workflow

Follow the instructions to install the VeeRwolf environment and the Zephyr Project on the virtual machine. Once installed, test the experimental setup and complete the assigned exercises.

### Tasks to complete between July 7–10

- Prepare the experimental setup by following sections 1–3 of the [*Running Zephyr on VeeRwolf*](Zephyr-VeeRwolf.md) document.

### July 11 – Session Tasks

Complete the following exercises:

- Understand the process of compiling a Zephyr application and running it on both the simulator and the FPGA board (see section 4 of [*Running Zephyr on VeeRwolf*](Zephyr-VeeRwolf.md)).
- Follow and analyze the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers demo in Zephyr (section 5 of [*Running Zephyr on VeeRwolf*](Zephyr-VeeRwolf.md)).
- Follow and analyze the [*Zephyr Blinky Sample*](Zephyr-Blinky.md) and then complete the LED control exercise.
- Study the [*VeeRWolf Zephyr Module*](Zephyr-VeeRwolf-Module.md) document to understand the structure of Zephyr's support for the VeeRWolf SoC, and then complete the related exercises.
