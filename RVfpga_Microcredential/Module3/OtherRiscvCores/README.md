# Other RISC-V Cores

In recent years, the open-source hardware ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable surge in the development and adoption of RISC-V cores. Thanks to its open and modular instruction set architecture, RISC-V has empowered academia, industry, and hobbyists to design and share a wide variety of cores tailored to different needsâ€”from ultra-minimal implementations for microcontrollers to complex out-of-order processors for high-performance computing. In this page we explore a selection of these open RISC-V cores, highlighting their features, use cases, and the vibrant community driving this innovation.

1. Look at the following presentation: [OtherRiscvCores](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1N_pWZ8oRKA0aUdZg2EKY66rlhnqzTMtF/view?usp=sharing).
2. Look at the following video showing the execution of CVW-Wally in Verilator: ...
3. Follow these steps to replicate the Verilator CVW-Wally simulation in the VM:
    * Install version 5.032 of Verilator. (You can also download a pre-compiled version here: [Verilator](https://ucomplutense-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dani02_ucm_es/EQpVNYBVJU1Loxn6iQGpHOABhR8v2-vyy88wdoDhW6lK6w?e=EnotZD). Once downloaded, unzip and move it to the home of the VM.)
    * Install version 14.2.0 of the RISC-V toolchain. (You can also download a pre-compiled version here: [Toolchain](https://ucomplutense-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dani02_ucm_es/EWcHZ40cZQtNtRncy7UWnIgBIi7chrEkSuS_IhD6Z4KkVw?e=Sgd3jE). Once downloaded, unzip and move it to the home of the VM.)
    * Clone recursively the sources from the [CVW Wally repo](https://github.com/openhwgroup/cvw). (You can also download a prepared version of Wally here: [Wally](https://ucomplutense-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dani02_ucm_es/EYY6Vou-SONEj9FqHHnBZ44BT5nQaA02E27KNKz-nXCeKg?e=5lOg5A). Once downloaded, unzip and move it to the home of the VM.)
    * Arrange the paths properly. We next show how to set the paths in case you download the pre-compiled tools mentioned above:

       ```
       export VERILATOR_ROOT=/home/rvfpga/verilator_5-032/
       export PATH=$VERILATOR_ROOT/bin:$PATH
       export INCLUDE_PATH=$VERILATOR_ROOT/include
       export RISCV=/home/rvfpga/RiscvToolchain/
       export PATH=$RISCV/bin:$PATH
       export WALLY=/home/rvfpga/Wally/cvw/
       export PATH=$WALLY/bin:$PATH
       ```

    * In the Makefile used for Verilator (```~/cvw/sim/verilator/Makefile```), add the option to generate a trace (```PARAMS?=--trace```).
    * We next show an example execution of this [ExampleExtended](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uw06q4ee5MpxFQbyur60pgeGmBbOzFaC/view?usp=sharing). This is the program obtained using the ```riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump``` aplication.

      ```
      00000000000100b0 <rvtest_entry_point>:
         100b0:	02a00513          	li	a0,42
         100b4:	00000393          	li	t2,0
         100b8:	24000813          	li	a6,576
      
      00000000000100bc <REPEAT>:
         100bc:	00138393          	addi	t2,t2,1
         100c0:	ff039ee3          	bne	t2,a6,100bc <REPEAT>
      
      00000000000100c4 <self_loop>:
         100c4:	0000006f          	j	100c4 <self_loop>
      ```


    * This is an example of commands to compile and simulate the example program, and to then visualize the trace:

       ```
       cd ~/Wally/cvw/examples/asm/example_extended
       riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -march=rv64im -mabi=lp64 -nostdlib -o example_extended example_extended.S
       riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d example_extended > example_extended.objdump
       wsim --vcd --sim verilator rv64gc --elf example_extended
       gtkwave ~/Wally/cvw/sim/verilator/testbench.vcd
       ```

    * You can use this [tcl file](https://ucomplutense-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/dani02_ucm_es/ES3IKkkHj5JIsaDzGuW2dnoBrl2g4S7_kOiw1v7Rcy93dw?e=je4Sdb) to add signals to the gtkwave. For example, this is an example of the trace showing the clock, the 32-bit instruction, and the ALU result:

    * In the figure, you can see the instructions within the first and second iteration of the loop and the value obtained in the ALU for the addition.
