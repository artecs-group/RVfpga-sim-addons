In recent years, the open-source hardware ecosystem has witnessed a remarkable surge in the development and adoption of RISC-V cores. Thanks to its open and modular instruction set architecture, RISC-V has empowered academia, industry, and hobbyists to design and share a wide variety of cores tailored to different needsâ€”from ultra-minimal implementations for microcontrollers to complex out-of-order processors for high-performance computing. This presentation explores a selection of these open RISC-V cores, highlighting their features, use cases, and the vibrant community driving this innovation.
