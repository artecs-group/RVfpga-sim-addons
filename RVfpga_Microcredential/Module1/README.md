In this first module, the RISC-V architecture will be studied in detail, and various increasingly complex exercises will be carried out involving programming in assembly and C languages. In Topic 1, a very detailed analysis of the RISC-V architecture is included, covering its instruction set, registers and addressing modes, available data types, and more.

Next, since most software programs are written in a high-level language, Topic 2 presents a tutorial on how to create a project in C language using PlatformIO on VSCode, which can be executed on the RVfpga system. A series of exercises will be proposed so that students can practice writing their own programs in this high-level language.

Once the architecture has been introduced and the first projects completed, we will delve into the RISC-V assembly language. For this, Topic 3 first provides a brief overview of the RISC-V assembly language and then explains how to create and run an assembly program on the RVfpga system. As with C, exercises will be provided for students to practice by writing their own programs in RISC-V assembly.

To conclude the module, in Topic 4 we will work on a final project involving image processing routines. The project will include multiple source files, some written in C and others in assembly, and will demonstrate how C functions can call assembly routines and vice versa. Finally, exercises will be carried out to extend the project with new functionalities.
