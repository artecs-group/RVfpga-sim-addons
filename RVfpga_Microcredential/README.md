# Microcredential - RISC-V: Arquitectura y dise√±o basado en cores comerciales VeeR sobre FPGA

The course begins with an extensive introduction to RISC-V architecture and assembly programming, and continues with a series of input/output labs using a SoC based on the RISC-V VeeR EL2 and EH1 softcores.
Subsequently, a detailed study of these cores and their Verilog code is conducted. The goal of this study is for students not only to understand the design of the mentioned cores but also to be able to modify and/or integrate them into Systems-on-Chip (SoCs).
In the final module, a complete application will also be deployed, using Zephyr Project as the RTOS and TensorFlow Lite for microcontrollers. All developments will be carried out using Xilinx FPGAs.

The course will take place over six consecutive weeks, from May 26 to July 4. In-person sessions will be held every Friday. From Monday to Thursday, students will be required to complete various assignments.
